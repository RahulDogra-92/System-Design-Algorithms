# Description:
# HyperLogLog is a probabilistic algorithm used to estimate the cardinality (number of distinct elements) of a dataset with high accuracy and low memory usage.

# Use Case: Counting unique visitors to a website
# Python Example:

from hyperloglog import HyperLogLog

hll = HyperLogLog(0.01)  # Create an HLL with 1% error rate

# Simulate user visits
user_ids = ["user_{}".format(i) for i in range(100000)]
for user_id in user_ids:
    hll.add(user_id)

# Estimate the number of unique users
print(f"Estimated unique users: {len(hll)}")
